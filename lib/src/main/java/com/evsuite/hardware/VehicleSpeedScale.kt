/**
 * What `PERF_VEHICLE_SPEED` is actually in, per firmware generation.
 *
 * AAOS defines the property as metres per second, so every read was multiplied by 3.6. On
 * SWI68 that is wrong: the property already reports km/h, and multiplying a second time
 * scaled every derived distance by the same factor. A 2.4 km drive was recorded twice as
 * 8.46 km and 7.69 km — 124 and 129 km/h average over four minutes of town driving — and
 * dividing by 3.6 gives 2.35 km at 34 km/h, which is the drive that happened.
 *
 * The conversion is therefore evidence-gated like every other firmware-dependent read here.
 * A generation is listed only once a vehicle has shown it, and an unlisted generation keeps
 * the specified conversion: unproven, but wrong in the conservative direction, because a
 * speed read too high makes [VehicleWriteGate] refuse more often rather than less.
